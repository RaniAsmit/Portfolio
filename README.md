## What Is This?

This is my personal **Next.js** portfolio — built with `create-next-app`, styled with love, and hosted like a boss.  
Because if I don’t show off my work, how else will I get hired?

The real deal lives here: **[raniasmit.me](https://raniasmit.me)**. No dev servers, no nonsense.

## 🚫 How *Not* to Use This

For the curious rebels or accidental cloners out there, here's how you could run it locally (but let’s be honest, why would you):

```bash
npm run dev      # or yarn dev
# or pnpm dev
# or bun dev (if you're trying too hard)
